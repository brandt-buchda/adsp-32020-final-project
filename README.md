The objective of this project is to fine-tune Meta’s large language model from a general text completion system to an optimized assistant using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we will implement Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), DeepSeek’s novel RL approach, to improve fine-tuning efficiency and model performance while optimizing computational resources.
